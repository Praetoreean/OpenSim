Telepad Instructions

This Networked Telepad system allows you to
create teleport points throughout a region.
Its almost too easy to use.
 
1)  Simply Rez a pad where you want a TP Point.
2)  Edit the description (*not* the name) of
     the object to the name of the place
     (House, Pool, Skybox, etc...)
3)  Click on the telepad, and choose "Reset" 
     from the dialog box. Only the owner can do this.
     (this adds the telepad to the network)
      
**Important** if you move a telepad, or delete one,
 you must use "Reset" to be sure all telepads receive
 the changes. (Reset just the one you moved, not all of them)
 
 To use it, touch it, choose the destination, then right
 click it and choose Teleport.
 
 ** advanced configuration options **
 If the description starts with a minus  (for example -Beach)
 then the telepad will serve as a direct telepad to that  location.
 
 To change the channel number for the network. Changet the number proceeding the colon in the 
 teleport pads description.
 For example    Beach:-99999
