# OpenSim 
OpenSim Related Scripts

This section contains my works for use in OpenSim Based Virtual Environments. I have organized the scripts in folders
relative to the object the work with In-World. These scripts were written to work with OpenSim v0.7.6, and have been tested to work on v0.8+

Each folder has it's own project specific information contained therein. Also the scripts are somewhat commented. :-)
I'm not big into comments sorry...
